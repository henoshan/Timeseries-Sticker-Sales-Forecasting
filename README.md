# 📌 Forecasting Sticker Sales  

## 🏆 Kaggle Playground Series 2025 – Forecasting Challenge  

This repository contains my solution for the **Forecasting Sticker Sales** competition in the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series**. The goal is to predict sticker sales across different stores and countries using a **synthetic dataset** that simulates real-world patterns like **seasonality, holidays, and trends**.

- **sample_submission.csv** – Sample file for correct submission format.
