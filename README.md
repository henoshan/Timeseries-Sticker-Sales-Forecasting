# 📌 Forecasting Sticker Sales  

## 🏆 Kaggle Playground Series 2025 – Forecasting Challenge  

This repository contains my solution for the **Forecasting Sticker Sales** competition in the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series**. The goal is to predict sticker sales across different stores and countries using a **synthetic dataset** that simulates real-world patterns like **seasonality, holidays, and trends**.

## 📂 Dataset  

- **train.csv** – Sales data for each date-country-store-item combination.  
- **test.csv** – Data for which sales (num_sold) need to be predicted.  
- **sample_submission.csv** – Sample file for correct submission format.
